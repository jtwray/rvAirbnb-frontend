## Project Overview

5th wheel Airbnb is a company that connects land owners and 5th wheel / RV owners. 
RV parks are often cramped and in many areas are booked months in advance. üìÖ 
üèï Collectively, landowners hold vast swaths of unused land that could be earning them revenue. 
By using 5th wheel Airbnb, 
  - üíë  RV owners get access to use these previously unknown/unavailable sites, üèûüöå
  - üí∞ and Landowners get to cash-in on otherwise dormant or underutilized land/>

## Tech Stack
React | Redux | ReactRouter V4 | Netlify | Formik | Yup | Axios | JWT | Material UI | Styled-Componenets
### Front end built using:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-v16.13.1-blue.svg)

-    Declarative --Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
-    Component-Based --Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
-    Learn Once, Write Anywhere --You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-v4.0.5-blueviolet.svg)
 
-   Single immutable state tree
-   Ease of Testing
-   Global Store of App State

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/BWPT-KidsFly/Backend) built using:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/) ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/express-v4.17.1-lightgrey.svg)

-    Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
-    Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
-    The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/pg-v8.2.1-blue.svg)

-    Implements the SQL standard very well.
-    Completely open source.
-    It supports lots of advanced data types, such as (multi-dimensional) arrays, user-defined types, etc.

## Testing

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) ![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/jest-v4.2.4-red.svg)
-   Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

## APIs
##### the HERE and UnSplash api both require environment variables to be created in the .env file of this project

- there are some links here to get you started
  -  youll need to register an account on each site and jump a couple hoops to get each key
- put the key in the .env and your golden
- make sure the variables match whats expected in this projects endpoint calls

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ HERE api distance or directions to anthing nearby based on geolocation
 - https://developer.here.com/sign-up?create=Freemium-Basic&keepState=true&step=account

 - the HERE api is provides nearby amenitites relative to the users current geolocation
 - it can also provide routing, driving or walking directions, airport or train schedules
 - whole lot of power here. go crazy build something special 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ UNSPLASH API - High Quality Free images serachable by key word / collection / user / random 

-To access the Unsplash API, first join UnSplash with a regular account
  -[create Unsplash account](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications)
- register your normal account as a dev account to gain access to the api
  - [developer account](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)
  - Once your account has been registered for the API, go to your apps.
  - Click ‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù, and fill in the required details. to request an api key for a specific application

- Initially, your application will be in demo mode 
  - and will be rate-limited to 50 requests per hour. 
  - This is perfect for demo apps, trying out the API, and for educational purposes.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY_= your-randomized-api-key-from-unsplash-goes-here-noquotes
``` 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ BOM Browser Object Model & geolocation api 
  This api integrates with the skyscanner-flight-search allowing the user to find and store their home airport by latitude and longitude coordinates available through the current browser session on the user's device.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables; 
Either in their local path
- on the path of the container
- image spun up
- accessible through a custom 3rd party server
- or in a .env file at the root of the project

The .env file could contain the following ( no spaces | no <>'s | no "quotes" ):
- REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_API_:<your registered access token with the UnSplash Platform>
- REACT_APP_HERE_API_:<your registered access key with HERE platform>
